To begin using do the following.
```
  git clone  git@github.com:veg/veg-hiv-env.git
  cd veg-hiv-env
  bower install
```  
Then open `test.html` in a browser. Note that this may not work in some browsers, e.g. Chrome because of how it implements the same origin policy for file:/// URLS; in this case put the directory in somewhere that can be accessed by HTTP.

You need to have the [bower](http://bower.io) package manager installed (which itself needs `npm`).
For documentation and data file format explanations please see the [wiki](wiki).
